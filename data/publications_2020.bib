	abstract = {The pressing need to reduce the capacity of deep neural networks has stimulated the development of network dilution methods and their analysis. While the ability of \$L\_1\$ and \$L\_0\$ regularization to encourage sparsity is often mentioned, \$L\_2\$ regularization is seldom discussed in this context. We present a novel framework for weight pruning by sampling from a probability function that favors the zeroing of smaller weights. In addition, we examine the contribution of \$L\_1\$ and \$L\_2\$ regularization to the dynamics of node pruning while optimizing for weight pruning. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic framework when used together with a weight decay regularizer on popular classification models in removing 50\% of the nodes in an MLP for MNIST classification, 60\% of the filters in VGG-16 for CIFAR10 classification, and on medical image models in removing 60\% of the channels in a U-Net for instance segmentation and 50\% of the channels in CNN model for COVID-19 detection. For these node-pruned networks, we also present competitive weight pruning results that are only slightly less accurate than the original, dense networks.},

	abstract = {A main challenge in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is speeding up scan time. Beyond improving patient experience and reducing operational costs, faster scans are essential for time-sensitive imaging, such as fetal, cardiac, or functional MRI, where temporal resolution is important and target movement is unavoidable, yet must be reduced. Current MRI acquisition methods speed up scan time at the expense of lower spatial resolution and costlier hardware. We introduce a practical, software-only framework, based on deep learning, for accelerating MRI acquisition, while maintaining anatomically meaningful imaging. This is accomplished by MRI subsampling followed by estimating the missing k-space samples via generative adversarial neural networks. A generator-discriminator interplay enables the introduction of an adversarial cost in addition to fidelity and image-quality losses used for optimizing the reconstruction. Promising reconstruction results are obtained from feasible sampling patterns of up to a fivefold acceleration of diverse brain MRIs, from a large publicly available dataset of healthy adult scans as well as multimodal acquisitions of multiple sclerosis patients and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) sequences of stroke and tumor patients. Clinical usability of the reconstructed MRI scans is assessed by performing either lesion or healthy tissue segmentation and comparing the results to those obtained by using the original, fully sampled images. Reconstruction quality and usability of the DCE-MRI sequences is demonstrated by calculating the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. The proposed MRI reconstruction approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods for all datasets tested in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM), as well as either the mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the PK parameters, calculated for the fully sampled DCE-MRI sequences, or the segmentation compatibility, measured in terms of Dice scores and Hausdorff distance. The code is available on GitHub.},

	abstract = {We present a Deep Learning framework for the prediction of chronological age from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Previous findings associate increased brain age with neurodegenerative diseases and higher mortality rates. However, the importance of brain age prediction goes beyond serving as biomarkers for neurological disorders. Specifically, utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis to identify brain regions contributing to the prediction can shed light on the complex multivariate process of brain aging. Previous work examined methods to attribute pixel/voxel-wise contributions to the prediction in a single image, resulting in “explanation maps” that were found noisy and unreliable. To address this problem, we developed an inference scheme for combining these maps across subjects, thus creating a population-based, rather than a subject-specific map. We applied this method to a CNN ensemble trained on predicting subjects' age from raw T1 brain images in a lifespan sample of 10,176 subjects. Evaluating the model on an untouched test set resulted in mean absolute error of 3.07 years and a correlation between chronological and predicted age of r = 0.98. Using the inference method, we revealed that cavities containing cerebrospinal fluid, previously found as general atrophy markers, had the highest contribution for age prediction. Comparing maps derived from different models within the ensemble allowed to assess differences and similarities in brain regions utilized by the model. We showed that this method substantially increased the replicability of explanation maps, converged with results from voxel-based morphometry age studies and highlighted brain regions whose volumetric variability correlated the most with the prediction error.},

	abstract = {We investigated brain wiring in chronic schizophrenia and healthy controls in frontostriatal circuits using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography in a novel way.We extracted diffusion streamlines in 27 chronic schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls connecting 4 frontal subregions to the striatum. We labeled the projection zone striatal surface voxels into 2 subtypes: dominant-input from a single cortical subregion, and, functionally integrative, with mixed-input from diverse cortical subregions.We showed: 1) a group difference for total striatal surface voxel number (P = .045) driven by fewer mixed-input voxels in the left (P  = .007), but not right, hemisphere; 2) a group by hemisphere interaction for the ratio quotient between voxel subtypes (P  = .04) with a left (P  = .006), but not right, hemisphere increase in schizophrenia, also reflecting fewer mixed-input voxels; and 3) fewer mixed-input voxel counts in schizophrenia (P  = .045) driven by differences in left hemisphere limbic (P  = .007) and associative (P  = .01), but not sensorimotor, striatum.These results demonstrate a less integrative pattern of frontostriatal structural connectivity in chronic schizophrenia. A diminished integrative pattern yields a less complex input pattern to the striatum from the cortex with less circuit integration at the level of the striatum. Further, as brain wiring occurs during early development, aberrant brain wiring could serve as a developmental biomarker for schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in American football players has garnered increasing public attention following reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive tauopathy. While the mechanisms underlying repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-induced neurodegeneration are unknown and antemortem diagnostic tests are not available, neuropathology studies suggest a pathogenic role for microvascular injury, specifically blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Thus, our main objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI approach we have developed to detect impairments in brain microvascular function. To this end, we scanned 42 adult male amateur American football players and a control group comprising 27 athletes practicing a non-contact sport and 26 non-athletes. MRI scans were also performed in 51 patients with brain pathologies involving the blood–brain barrier, namely malignant brain tumours, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic traumatic contusion. Based on data from prolonged scans, we generated maps that visualized the permeability value for each brain voxel. Our permeability maps revealed an increase in slow blood-to-brain transport in a subset of amateur American football players, but not in sex- and age-matched controls. The increase in permeability was region specific (white matter, midbrain peduncles, red nucleus, temporal cortex) and correlated with changes in white matter, which were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging. Additionally, increased permeability persisted for months, as seen in players who were scanned both on- and off-season. Examination of patients with brain pathologies revealed that slow tracer accumulation characterizes areas surrounding the core of injury, which frequently shows fast blood-to-brain transport. Next, we verified our method in two rodent models: rats and mice subjected to repeated mild closed-head impact injury, and rats with vascular injury inflicted by photothrombosis. In both models, slow blood-to-brain transport was observed, which correlated with neuropathological changes. Lastly, computational simulations and direct imaging of the transport of Evans blue-albumin complex in brains of rats subjected to recurrent seizures or focal cerebrovascular injury suggest that increased cellular transport underlies the observed slow blood-to-brain transport. Taken together, our findings suggest dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI can be used to diagnose specific microvascular pathology after traumatic brain injury and other brain pathologies.},

The key idea is a new technique for a differentiable construction of joint and color histograms of the output images. We further define a color distribution loss based on the Earth Mover's Distance between the output's and the reference's color histograms and a Mutual Information loss based on the joint histograms of the source and the output images. Promising results are shown for the tasks of color transfer, image colorization and edges \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ photo, where the color distribution of the output image is controlled.
