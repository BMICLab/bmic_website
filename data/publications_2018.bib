	abstract = {Image segmentation is often considered a deterministic process with a single ground truth. Nevertheless, in practice, and in particular, when medical imaging analysis is considered, the extraction of regions of interest (ROIs) is ill-posed and the concept of `most probable' segmentation is model-dependent. In this paper, a measure for segmentation uncertainty in the form of segmentation error margins is introduced. This measure provides a goodness quantity and allows a `fully informed' comparison between extracted boundaries of related ROIs as well as more meaningful statistical analysis. The tool we present is based on a novel technique for segmentation sampling in the Fourier domain and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method was applied to cortical and sub-cortical structure segmentation in MRI. Since the accuracy of segmentation error margins cannot be validated, we use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to support the proposed method. Precision and recall scores with respect to expert annotation suggest this method as a promising tool for a variety of medical imaging applications including user-interactive segmentation, patient follow-up, and cross-sectional analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a novel computational approach to detect white-matter brain impairments following stroke or Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). A key assumption in our study is that the two hemispheres are not affected identically. The pathology of white matter (WM) tracts can be thus identified according to the asymmetry level of brain diffusivity measures, such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD), extracted from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The proposed methodological contribution is based on the construction of a sequence of isosurfaces of these scalar measures and their symmetrical counterparts, obtained by reflecting the original isosurfaces. The modified Hausdorff distance is then used to measure the dissimilarity between each corresponding pair of aligned surfaces. The proposed method is assessed using datasets of normal controls (NCs), stroke patients and longitudinal brain scans of football players that might have been exposed to mild head traumas. Increased asymmetry with respect to NCs is shown for the stroke patients and some of the players indicating possible WM injuries.},

	abstract = {MRI Segmentation of a pathological brain poses a significant challenge, as the available anatomical priors that provide top-down information to aid segmentation are inadequate in the presence of abnormalities. This problem is further complicated for longitudinal data capturing impaired brain development or neurodegenerative conditions, since the dynamic of brain atrophies has to be considered as well. For these cases, the absence of compatible annotated training examples renders the commonly used multi-atlas or machine-learning approaches impractical. We present a novel segmentation approach that accounts for the lack of labeled data via multi-region multi-subject co-segmentation (MMCoSeg) of longitudinal MRI sequences. The underlying, unknown anatomy is learned throughout an iterative process, in which the segmentation of a region is supported both by the segmentation of the neighboring regions, which share common boundaries, and by the segmentation of corresponding regions, in the other jointly segmented images. A 4D multi-region atlas that models the spatio-temporal deformations and can be adapted to different subjects undergoing similar degeneration processes is reconstructed concurrently. An inducible mouse model of p25 accumulation (the CK-p25 mouse) that displays key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) is used as a gold-standard to test the proposed algorithm by providing a conditional control of rapid neurodegeneration. Applying the MMCoSeg to a cohort of CK-p25 mice and littermate controls yields promising segmentation results that demonstrate high compatibility with expertise manual annotations. An extensive comparative analysis with respect to current well-established, atlas-based segmentation methods highlights the advantage of the proposed approach, which provides accurate segmentation of longitudinal brain MRIs in pathological conditions, where only very few annotated examples are available.},

	abstract = {We present a novel computational framework for the analysis of high-throughput microscopy videos of living cells. The proposed framework is generally useful and can be applied to different datasets acquired in a variety of laboratory settings. This is accomplished by tying together two fundamental aspects of cell lineage construction, namely cell segmentation and tracking, via a Bayesian inference of dynamic models. In contrast to most existing approaches, which aim to be general, no assumption of cell shape is made. Spatial, temporal, and cross-sectional variation of the analysed data are accommodated by two key contributions. First, time series analysis is exploited to estimate the temporal cell shape uncertainty in addition to cell trajectory. Second, a fast marching (FM) algorithm is used to integrate the inferred cell properties with the observed image measurements in order to obtain image likelihood for cell segmentation, and association. The proposed approach has been tested on eight different time-lapse microscopy data sets, some of which are high-throughput, demonstrating promising results for the detection, segmentation and association of planar cells. Our results surpass the state of the art for the Fluo-C2DL-MSC data set of the Cell Tracking Challenge (Maška et al., 2014).},

	abstract = {Segmentation is a prevalent research area in medical imaging analysis. Nevertheless, estimation of the uncertainty margins of the extracted anatomical structure or pathology boundaries is seldom considered. This paper studies the concept of segmentation uncertainty of clinical images, acknowledging its great importance to patient follow up, user-interaction guidance, and morphology-based population studies. We propose a novel approach for model-dependent uncertainty estimation for image segmentation. The key contribution is an alternating, iterative algorithm for the generation of an image-specific uncertainty map. This is accomplished by defining a consistency-based measure and applying it to segmentation samples to estimate the uncertainty margins as well as the midline segmentation. We utilize the stochastic active contour framework as our segmentation generator, yet any sampling method can be applied. The method is validated on synthetic data for well-defined objects blurred with known Gaussian kernels. Further assessment of the method is provided by an application of the proposed consistency-based algorithm to ensembles of stochastic segmentations of brain hemorrhage in CT scans.},

Our approach has two main strengths, similar to the GAN, the method does not require a formulation of a loss function for the optimization process. This allows training on a limited amount of annotated data in a weakly supervised manner. Promising segmentation results on real fluorescent microscopy data are presented.

By combining scalar diffusivity measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy) with fiber-flux measurements, we define new local descriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion DensityFiber-Flux Diffusion Density(FFDD) vectors. Applying each descriptor throughout fiber bundles allows along-tract coupling of a specific diffusion measure with geometrical properties, such as fiber orientation and coherence. A key step in the proposed framework is the construction of an FFDD dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on the fast marching methodfast marching method(FMM). The obtained aligned WM tract-profiles enable meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. We demonstrate our method using two different datasets of contact sports playerscontact sports players. Along-tract pairwise comparison as well as group-wise analysis, with respect to non-player healthy controls, reveal significant and spatially-consistent FFDD anomalies. Comparing our method with along-tract FA analysis shows improved sensitivity to subtle structural anomalies in football players over standard FA measurements.},
