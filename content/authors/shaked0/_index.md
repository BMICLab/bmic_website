I am a BS.c graduate of a double degree in Mathematics & Electrical and Computer Engineering (graduated with honors). And currently a Masterâ€™s student.

My main interest in research is Computer Vision, Image Processing and Deep learning. In the lab most of my work is in the subject of cell microscopy images, specifically cell segmentation. We also published in IEEE TMI .
