Graduated with a B.Sc in Computer Science from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Proceeded to work for a couple of years before returning to the academia for my M.Sc at Ariel University. My thesis dealt with Tunable Networks for Image Restoration.

Currently I'm a P.hD at Ben-Gurion University under the supervision of Dr. Andri Sherf and Prof. Tammy Riklin-Raviv.
