abstract: We introduce the HueNet - a novel deep learning framework for a
  differentiable construction of intensity (1D) and joint (2D) histograms and
  present its applicability to paired and unpaired image-to-image translation
  problems. The key idea is an innovative technique for augmenting a generative
  neural network by histogram layers appended to the image generator. These
  histogram layers allow us to define two new histogram-based loss functions for
  constraining the structural appearance of the synthesized output image and its
  color distribution. Specifically, the color similarity loss is defined by the
  Earth Mover's Distance between the intensity histograms of the network output
  and a color reference image. The structural similarity loss is determined by
  the mutual information between the output and a content reference image based
  on their joint histogram. Although the HueNet can be applied to a variety of
  image-to-image translation problems, we chose to demonstrate its strength on
  the tasks of color transfer, exemplar-based image colorization, and edges â†’
  photo, where the colors of the output image are predefined. The code is
