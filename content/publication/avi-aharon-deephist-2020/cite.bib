 abstract = {We present the DeepHist - a novel Deep Learning framework for augmenting a network by histogram layers and demonstrate its strength by addressing image-to-image translation problems. Specifically, given an input image and a reference color distribution we aim to generate an output image with the structural appearance (content) of the input (source) yet with the colors of the reference. The key idea is a new technique for a differentiable construction of joint and color histograms of the output images. We further define a color distribution loss based on the Earth Mover's Distance between the output's and the reference's color histograms and a Mutual Information loss based on the joint histograms of the source and the output images. Promising results are shown for the tasks of color transfer, image colorization and edges \$\rightarrow\$ photo, where the color distribution of the output image is controlled. Comparison to Pix2Pix and CyclyGANs are shown.},
